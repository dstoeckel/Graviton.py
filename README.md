Graviton.py
===========

This package provides rudimentary bindings for Python 2/3 to the API of
Graviton based web-services such GeneTrail2.

**This is an initial release lacking quite some functionality.**

Installing
----------
You can install this package using the `pip` package manager:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dstoeckel/Graviton.py.git
```

Keep in mind that you either need to install this into a [virtual
environment][1] or, for global installs, need superuser permissions.
